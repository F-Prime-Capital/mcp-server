# MCP Server 
## Austin Yang, Mike Feng 

We aim to migrate the functionality of fprime-datascience.com into an MCP server that can be directly linked into an F-Prime AI API. Some of the current functionalities that we are working on include: 
- Company Search
- Filter Documents
- Query Documents
- Similar People Search

Once completed, we believe this MCP will make the process of getting the relevant information investors may need more streamlined and efficient.
